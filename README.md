# 🌦️ Weather App – React Project

This is a simple and interactive **Weather App** built with React. It allows users to search for a city and view real-time weather information such as temperature, conditions, and icons fetched from a weather API. The project demonstrates API integration, dynamic rendering, and clean UI design.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen the following skills:

1. **API Integration** – Fetching live weather data using `fetch()` in React.  
2. **State Management** – Using `useState` and `useEffect` to handle API data and user input.  
3. **Conditional Rendering** – Displaying loading/error messages and weather details dynamically.  
4. **Controlled Components** – Managing search input fields with React state.  
5. **Dynamic Styling** – Updating UI visuals based on weather conditions.
